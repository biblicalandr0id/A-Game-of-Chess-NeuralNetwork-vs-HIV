   - Protein expression levels (64 features)
   - Membrane state (32 features)
   - Internal vesicle status (32 features)

2. HIV State Vector (dim=128):
   - Surface protein configurations (64 features)

   - Recognition patterns (32 features)
   - Attack readiness (32 features)

## Action Space

### HIV Actions (dim=64):
- Surface protein mutations (32 possible actions)
- Binding site modifications (16 possible actions)
- Replication timing (16 possible actions)

### Defense Actions (dim=64):
- Marker protein deployment (32 possible actions)

## Network Architecture

```
Input Layer (384) -> Dense(512) -> BatchNorm -> ReLU
                 -> ResBlock(512) x 10
                 -> Policy Head (128) -> Softmax (64 actions)
                 -> Value Head (1) -> Tanh
```

## Reward Function

R(s,a) = w1*P(survival) + w2*P(immune_evasion) - w3*P(detection) - w4*E(resource_cost)

Where:
- P(survival) = probability of viral survival
- P(immune_evasion) = probability of evading immune system
- P(detection) = probability of being detected
- E(resource_cost) = energy cost of actions
- w1,w2,w3,w4 = weight parameters

## Training Process

1. Self-Play Generation:
   - Initialize random strategies
   - Play HIV vs. Defense games
   - Store (state, action, reward) tuples

2. Network Update:
   - Policy loss: L_π = -log(π(a|s)) * A(s,a)
   - Value loss: L_v = (V(s) - R)²
   - Total loss: L = L_π + c1*L_v + c2*L_reg

3. MCTS Parameters:
   - Simulation depth: 50 steps
   - Number of simulations: 1600 per move
   - Temperature parameter τ: 1.0 -> 0.1
   - Dirichlet noise: α = 0.3

## Evaluation Metrics

1. Win Rate vs. Random Strategy
2. Average Survival Time
3. Immune Evasion Success Rate
4. Resource Efficiency
5. Novel Strategy Discovery Rate

## Implementation Notes

1. State Compression:
   - Use autoencoder to compress protein configurations
   - Maintain biological constraints in state space

2. Action Constraints:
   - Enforce biological feasibility
   - Energy conservation rules
   - Reaction rate limits

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Batch size: 512
   - Learning rate: 2e-4 with cosine decay
   - Gradient clipping at 1.0
