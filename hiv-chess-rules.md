# HIV Defense Chess - Strategic Game Design

## Board Layout

An 8x8 board with modified pieces representing:

### HIV Forces (Black)
- King: HIV Core (must be protected)
- Queens: Surface Protein Complexes (highly mobile, adaptable)
- Bishops: RNA Strands (diagonal movement, replication capability)
- Knights: Mutation Vectors (unpredictable movement)
- Rooks: Viral Factories (straight-line penetration)
- Pawns: Basic Viral Particles (limited forward movement)

### Immune System Forces (White)
- King: Central Immune Memory
- Queens: Antibody Complexes
- Bishops: T-Cell Coordinators
- Knights: Marker Proteins
- Rooks: Immune Response Centers
- Pawns: Basic Immune Cells

## Special Rules

1. Mutation Mechanics
- HIV pieces can "mutate" once per 3 turns
- Mutation allows a piece to change its movement pattern for one turn
- Costs one "energy point" (new resource system)

2. Protein Marking
- Knight pieces (Marker Proteins) can "tag" enemy pieces
- Tagged pieces become visible even when hidden
- Tagged pieces are vulnerable to capture by any immune piece

3. Hidden Information
- HIV pieces can become "hidden" by spending energy
- Immune system must use Knights to reveal hidden pieces
- Some squares act as "detection zones"

4. Resource Management
- Both sides collect "energy points" each turn
- Energy used for special abilities
- HIV needs energy for hiding and mutation
- Immune system uses energy for detection and response

5. Victory Conditions
Primary win conditions:
- HIV: Capture Immune King or infect 75% of the board
- Immune System: Capture HIV King or eliminate 75% of HIV forces

## Special Moves

1. HIV Forces:
- "Surface Shift": Queens can change their attack pattern
- "Rapid Replication": Bishops can create new pawns
- "Stealth Mode": Pieces can hide at energy cost
- "Mutation Burst": Multiple pieces can mutate at once

2. Immune System:
- "Mass Detection": Knights reveal all hidden pieces in range
- "Antibody Response": Queens can lock down HIV movement
- "Memory Formation": Special defensive formations
- "Rapid Response": Multiple pieces can move in one turn

## Strategic Elements

1. Position Control
- Key squares represent critical cell regions
- Control of central squares affects energy generation
- Some squares provide defensive bonuses

2. Resource Management
- Balance between using energy for special abilities
- Saving energy for critical moments
- Trading pieces vs. maintaining force strength

3. Information Warfare
- Tracking hidden HIV pieces
- Predicting mutation patterns
- Controlling detection zones

## Game Phases

1. Opening (Initial Contact)
- HIV establishes hiding positions
- Immune system sets up detection network
- Both sides gather initial energy

2. Midgame (Active Combat)
- Heavy use of special abilities
- Territory control becomes crucial
- Resource management most important

3. Endgame (Final Resolution)
- Reduced pieces but higher stakes
- Special abilities become game-deciding
- Victory conditions come into focus

## Training Implementation

1. Neural Network Focus Areas:
- Pattern recognition for effective mutations
- Resource optimization
- Position evaluation
- Move sequence planning

2. Learning Objectives:
- Identify optimal hiding patterns
- Develop mutation strategies
- Master energy management
- Learn counter-strategies

3. Success Metrics:
- Win rate
- Energy efficiency
- Territory control
- Piece preservation
- Strategy innovation

## Biological Parallels

Each game mechanic directly maps to HIV/Immune system interaction:
- Mutation mechanic → viral mutation
- Hidden information → immune evasion
- Resource management → cellular energy
- Special moves → protein interactions
- Board control → body-wide infection spread
